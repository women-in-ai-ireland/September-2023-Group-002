# September-2023-Group-002
This is the Group 002 repository for the WaiPRACTICE September 2023 cohort.
Define business problem (what data to use)
Define customer behaviour (tenure, subsequent orders count, net sales: how recent did the customers register with the retailer, how frequent did they come back, how much did they spend)
Define channel performance (Source of Customer and Cost: how did they know about the retailer and does that break even with the cost?)
Define demographic differences (Age Group, Gender, Location)

Visualise the correlations
1. Visualise the growth of net sales and total numbers of orders during the three months
2. Build the RFM model to find leads (to answer the question "who")
3. Put together and visualise source of customers, net sales, and cost (why is there no paid social cost data?)
